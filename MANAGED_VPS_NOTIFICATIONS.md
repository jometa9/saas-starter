### Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Managed VPS user updates account] --> B[System detects action]
    B --> C{Does user have Managed VPS plan?}
    C -->|No| D[Do nothing]
    C -->|Yes| E[Get administrators list]
    E --> F[Prepare notification data]
    F --> G[Generate email with template]
    G --> H[Send to all admins]
    H --> I[Log result]
```

### Sending Conditions

Notification is sent ONLY when:

- âœ… User has `"IPTRADE Managed VPS"` plan
- âœ… Subscription status is `"active"`, `"trialing"` or `"admin_assigned"`
- âœ… At least one administrator user exists in the system
- âœ… Action is one of: `created`, `updated`, `deleted`

### Email Configuration

Uses the same system email configuration:

- Support for **Resend** (recommended) or **Nodemailer** (fallback)
- Respects development/production configurations
- Error handling without blocking main operation

## How to Test

### 1. Test Endpoint

```bash
POST /api/admin/test-managed-vps-notification
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>

{
  "action": "updated",
  "accountNumber": "123456789",
  "platform": "mt5",
  "accountType": "master"
}
```

### 2. Real Test

1. Create a user with "IPTRADE Managed VPS" plan
2. Ensure the user has "active" status
3. Create, update or delete a trading account for the user
4. Verify that administrators receive the email

### 3. Log Verification

Search in server logs:

```
Managed VPS user [email] [action] account, admins notified
Sent Managed VPS update notification to X/Y admins
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The functionality uses the following existing variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Base URL for links in the email
- `RESEND_API_KEY` or SMTP configuration: For email sending

### User Roles

- `admin`: Receives notifications
- `superadmin`: Receives notifications
- `member`: Does not receive notifications (regular users only)

## Security and Performance

### Security Features

- âœ… **Permission validation**: Only users with active Managed VPS plan trigger notifications
- âœ… **Administrator filtering**: Only users with admin/superadmin role receive emails
- âœ… **No sensitive data exposure**: Passwords are never included in notifications

### Performance Optimization

- âœ… **Non-blocking operation**: Email errors don't block main operations
- âœ… **Dynamic imports**: Email modules are loaded only when needed
- âœ… **Error handling**: Individual failures don't affect other notifications
- âœ… **Efficient logging**: Only important events are recorded

## Maintenance

### Recommended Monitoring

1. **Sending logs**: Regularly check notification logs
2. **Administrator status**: Ensure active admin users exist
3. **Email configuration**: Verify email service is working

### Possible Future Improvements

- [ ] **Configuration panel**: Allow admins to subscribe/unsubscribe
- [ ] **Advanced filters**: Allow filtering by action type or user
- [ ] **Daily digest**: Option to receive daily summary instead of immediate notifications
- [ ] **Webhooks**: Support for webhook notifications in addition to email
- [ ] **Customizable templates**: Allow customizing template from admin panel
